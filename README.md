# Simulations

Simulations are done in `Jupyter Notebook`. Simulation code for various
sections of the circuit can be found in the 
[Simulations]([./Simulations](https://github.com/jatinchowdhury18/Aphex_Exciter/tree/master/Simulations)) folder.

# Implementation
Implementation is being done using [JUCE](https://github.com/WeAreROLI/JUCE).
Individual circuit components are each being made as a separate JUCE project,
and eventually a full implementation combining all of the subcomponents will
be made.
